Clustering States by Weather - Using K-means algorithm to cluster states by weather. 

Quick analysis (to be expanded upon soon...)

4 clusters seems to be a good balance. With 5, NY was by itself. I would caution any k-clustering when few states are in one cluster because a campaign would cost a lot of money only to reach one or two states. With only 3, clusters, the middle cluster seemed to include a pretty wide variety of temperature/snowfall accounts. 4 clusters seem to adequately put the states in groups where that middle section from the k = 3 is composed of and upper group and a lower group with each group have less variablity between each other (particularly the lower, blue, middle group). 

Note for future: Including another variable with either coordinates, or section of the US (i.e. NW, SW etc) would ensure that the k-nearest neighbors would take location into account as well
